erratta:

please explain waht is meant by the uint8_t blah<1..2^n-1>; notation

concat(... || credentials) should be concat(... || credentials.server_pub_key || credentials.etc)




AUthServerRespond is missing credential_response input



notes:

a really neat thing is that the PBKDF is done on the client, not the server
which... makes sense because one of the goals of the protocol is for the server
to never learn password-equivalent material
